                    PostgreSQL Installation Instructions

   This document describes the installation of PostgreSQL from the source
   code distribution. (If you are installing a pre-packaged distribution,
   such as an RPM or Debian package, ignore this document and read the
   packager's instructions instead.)

                                Requirements

   In general, a modern Unix-compatible platform should be able to run
   PostgreSQL. The platforms that had received specific testing at the
   time of release are listed in the Section called Supported Platforms
   below. In the "doc" subdirectory of the distribution there are several
   platform-specific FAQ documents you might wish to consult if you are
   having trouble.

   The following software packages are required for building PostgreSQL:

     * GNU make is required; other make programs will *not* work. GNU make
       is often installed under the name "gmake"; this document will
       always refer to it by that name. (On some systems GNU make is the
       default tool with the name "make".) To test for GNU make enter
gmake --version
       It is recommended to use version 3.76.1 or later.
     * You need an ISO/ANSI C compiler. Recent versions of GCC are
       recommendable, but PostgreSQL is known to build with a wide variety
       of compilers from different vendors.
     * tar is required to unpack the source distribution in the first
       place, in addition to either gzip or bzip2.
     * The GNU Readline library (for simple line editing and command
       history retrieval) is used by default. If you don't want to use it
       then you must specify the "--without-readline" option for
       "configure". As an alternative, you can often use the BSD-licensed
       "libedit" library, originally developed on NetBSD. The "libedit"
       library is GNU Readline-compatible and is used if "libreadline" is
       not found, or if "--with-libedit-preferred" is used as an option to
       "configure". If you are using a package-based Linux distribution,
       be aware that you need both the readline and readline-devel
       packages, if those are separate in your distribution.
     * The zlib compression library will be used by default. If you don't
       want to use it then you must specify the "--without-zlib" option
       for "configure". Using this option disables support for compressed
       archives in pg_dump and pg_restore.

   The following packages are optional. They are not required in the
   default configuration, but they are needed when certain build options
   are enabled, as explained below.

     * To build the server programming language PL/Perl you need a full
       Perl installation, including the "libperl" library and the header
       files. Since PL/Perl will be a shared library, the "libperl"
       library must be a shared library also on most platforms. This
       appears to be the default in recent Perl versions, but it was not
       in earlier versions, and in any case it is the choice of whomever
       installed Perl at your site.
       If you don't have the shared library but you need one, a message
       like this will appear during the build to point out this fact:
*** Cannot build PL/Perl because libperl is not a shared library.
*** You might have to rebuild your Perl installation.  Refer to
*** the documentation for details.
       (If you don't follow the on-screen output you will merely notice
       that the PL/Perl library object, "plperl.so" or similar, will not
       be installed.) If you see this, you will have to rebuild and
       install Perl manually to be able to build PL/Perl. During the
       configuration process for Perl, request a shared library.
     * To build the PL/Python server programming language, you need a
       Python installation with the header files and the distutils module.
       The distutils module is included by default with Python 1.6 and
       later; users of earlier versions of Python will need to install it.
       Since PL/Python will be a shared library, the "libpython" library
       must be a shared library also on most platforms. This is not the
       case in a default Python installation. If after building and
       installing you have a file called "plpython.so" (possibly a
       different extension), then everything went well. Otherwise you
       should have seen a notice like this flying by:
*** Cannot build PL/Python because libpython is not a shared library.
*** You might have to rebuild your Python installation.  Refer to
*** the documentation for details.
       That means you have to rebuild (part of) your Python installation
       to supply this shared library.
       If you have problems, run Python 2.3 or later's configure using the
       --enable-shared flag. On some operating systems you don't have to
       build a shared library, but you will have to convince the
       PostgreSQL build system of this. Consult the "Makefile" in the
       "src/pl/plpython" directory for details.
     * If you want to build the PL/Tcl procedural language, you of course
       need a Tcl installation. If you are using a pre-8.4 release of Tcl,
       ensure that it was built without multithreading support.
     * To enable Native Language Support (NLS), that is, the ability to
       display a program's messages in a language other than English, you
       need an implementation of the Gettext API. Some operating systems
       have this built-in (e.g., Linux, NetBSD, Solaris), for other
       systems you can download an add-on package from
       http://developer.postgresql.org/~petere/bsd-gettext/. If you are
       using the Gettext implementation in the GNU C library then you will
       additionally need the GNU Gettext package for some utility
       programs. For any of the other implementations you will not need
       it.
     * Kerberos, OpenSSL, OpenLDAP, and/or PAM, if you want to support
       authentication or encryption using these services.

   If you are building from a CVS tree instead of using a released source
   package, or if you want to do development, you also need the following
   packages:

     * GNU Flex and Bison are needed to build a CVS checkout or if you
       changed the actual scanner and parser definition files. If you need
       them, be sure to get Flex 2.5.4 or later and Bison 1.875 or later.
       Other yacc programs can sometimes be used, but doing so requires
       extra effort and is not recommended. Other lex programs will
       definitely not work.

   If you need to get a GNU package, you can find it at your local GNU
   mirror site (see http://www.gnu.org/order/ftp.html for a list) or at
   ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/.

   Also check that you have sufficient disk space. You will need about 65
   MB for the source tree during compilation and about 15 MB for the
   installation directory. An empty database cluster takes about 25 MB,
   databases take about five times the amount of space that a flat text
   file with the same data would take. If you are going to run the
   regression tests you will temporarily need up to an extra 90 MB. Use
   the "df" command to check free disk space.
     __________________________________________________________________

                                  Upgrading

   These instructions assume that your existing installation is under the
   "/usr/local/pgsql" directory, and that the data area is in
   "/usr/local/pgsql/data". Substitute your paths appropriately.

   The internal data storage format typically changes in every major
   release of PostgreSQL. Therefore, if you are upgrading an existing
   installation that does not have a version number of "8.3.x", you must
   back up and restore your data. If you are upgrading from PostgreSQL
   "8.3.x", the new version can use your current data files so you should
   skip the backup and restore steps below because they are unnecessary.
    1. If making a backup, make sure that your database is not being
       updated. This does not affect the integrity of the backup, but the
       changed data would of course not be included. If necessary, edit
       the permissions in the file "/usr/local/pgsql/data/pg_hba.conf" (or
       equivalent) to disallow access from everyone except you.
       To back up your database installation, type:
pg_dumpall > outputfile
       If you need to preserve OIDs (such as when using them as foreign
       keys), then use the "-o" option when running pg_dumpall.
       To make the backup, you can use the pg_dumpall command from the
       version you are currently running. For best results, however, try
       to use the pg_dumpall command from PostgreSQL 8.3.5, since this
       version contains bug fixes and improvements over older versions.
       While this advice might seem idiosyncratic since you haven't
       installed the new version yet, it is advisable to follow it if you
       plan to install the new version in parallel with the old version.
       In that case you can complete the installation normally and
       transfer the data later. This will also decrease the downtime.
    2. Shut down the old server:
pg_ctl stop
       On systems that have PostgreSQL started at boot time, there is
       probably a start-up file that will accomplish the same thing. For
       example, on a Red Hat Linux system one might find that
/etc/rc.d/init.d/postgresql stop
       works.
    3. If restoring from backup, rename or delete the old installation
       directory. It is a good idea to rename the directory, rather than
       delete it, in case you have trouble and need to revert to it. Keep
       in mind the directory might consume significant disk space. To
       rename the directory, use a command like this:
mv /usr/local/pgsql /usr/local/pgsql.old
    4. Install the new version of PostgreSQL as outlined in the next
       section.
    5. Create a new database cluster if needed. Remember that you must
       execute these commands while logged in to the special database user
       account (which you already have if you are upgrading).
/usr/local/pgsql/bin/initdb -D /usr/local/pgsql/data
    6. Restore your previous "pg_hba.conf" and any "postgresql.conf"
       modifications.
    7. Start the database server, again from the special database user
       account:
/usr/local/pgsql/bin/postgres -D /usr/local/pgsql/data
    8. Finally, restore your data from backup with
/usr/local/pgsql/bin/psql -d postgres -f outputfile
       using the *new* psql.

   Further discussion appears in the documentation, including instructions
   on how the previous installation can continue running while the new
   installation is installed.

                           Installation Procedure

    1. Configuration
       The first step of the installation procedure is to configure the
       source tree for your system and choose the options you would like.
       This is done by running the "configure" script. For a default
       installation simply enter
./configure
       This script will run a number of tests to guess values for various
       system dependent variables and detect some quirks of your operating
       system, and finally will create several files in the build tree to
       record what it found. (You can also run "configure" in a directory
       outside the source tree if you want to keep the build directory
       separate.)
       The default configuration will build the server and utilities, as
       well as all client applications and interfaces that require only a
       C compiler. All files will be installed under "/usr/local/pgsql" by
       default.
       You can customize the build and installation process by supplying
       one or more of the following command line options to "configure":

        --prefix=PREFIX
                Install all files under the directory "PREFIX" instead of
                "/usr/local/pgsql". The actual files will be installed
                into various subdirectories; no files will ever be
                installed directly into the "PREFIX" directory.

                If you have special needs, you can also customize the
                individual subdirectories with the following options.
                However, if you leave these with their defaults, the
                installation will be relocatable, meaning you can move the
                directory after installation. (The man and doc locations
                are not affected by this.)

                For relocatable installs, you might want to use
                "configure"'s --disable-rpath option. Also, you will need
                to tell the operating system how to find the shared
                libraries.

        --exec-prefix=EXEC-PREFIX
                You can install architecture-dependent files under a
                different prefix, "EXEC-PREFIX", than what "PREFIX" was
                set to. This can be useful to share
                architecture-independent files between hosts. If you omit
                this, then "EXEC-PREFIX" is set equal to "PREFIX" and both
                architecture-dependent and independent files will be
                installed under the same tree, which is probably what you
                want.

        --bindir=DIRECTORY
                Specifies the directory for executable programs. The
                default is "EXEC-PREFIX/bin", which normally means
                "/usr/local/pgsql/bin".

        --datadir=DIRECTORY
                Sets the directory for read-only data files used by the
                installed programs. The default is "PREFIX/share". Note
                that this has nothing to do with where your database files
                will be placed.

        --sysconfdir=DIRECTORY
                The directory for various configuration files,
                "PREFIX/etc" by default.

        --libdir=DIRECTORY
                The location to install libraries and dynamically loadable
                modules. The default is "EXEC-PREFIX/lib".

        --includedir=DIRECTORY
                The directory for installing C and C++ header files. The
                default is "PREFIX/include".

        --mandir=DIRECTORY
                The man pages that come with PostgreSQL will be installed
                under this directory, in their respective "manx"
                subdirectories. The default is "PREFIX/man".

        --with-docdir=DIRECTORY, --without-docdir
                Documentation files, except "man" pages, will be installed
                into this directory. The default is "PREFIX/doc". If the
                option "--without-docdir" is specified, the documentation
                will not be installed by "make install". This is intended
                for packaging scripts that have special methods for
                installing documentation.

     Note: Care has been taken to make it possible to install PostgreSQL
     into shared installation locations (such as "/usr/local/include")
     without interfering with the namespace of the rest of the system.
     First, the string "/postgresql" is automatically appended to
     datadir, sysconfdir, and docdir, unless the fully expanded directory
     name already contains the string "postgres" or "pgsql". For example,
     if you choose "/usr/local" as prefix, the documentation will be
     installed in "/usr/local/doc/postgresql", but if the prefix is
     "/opt/postgres", then it will be in "/opt/postgres/doc". The public
     C header files of the client interfaces are installed into
     includedir and are namespace-clean. The internal header files and
     the server header files are installed into private directories under
     includedir. See the documentation of each interface for information
     about how to get at the its header files. Finally, a private
     subdirectory will also be created, if appropriate, under libdir for
     dynamically loadable modules.

        --with-includes=DIRECTORIES
                "DIRECTORIES" is a colon-separated list of directories
                that will be added to the list the compiler searches for
                header files. If you have optional packages (such as GNU
                Readline) installed in a non-standard location, you have
                to use this option and probably also the corresponding
                "--with-libraries" option.

                Example:
                --with-includes=/opt/gnu/include:/usr/sup/include.

        --with-libraries=DIRECTORIES
                "DIRECTORIES" is a colon-separated list of directories to
                search for libraries. You will probably have to use this
                option (and the corresponding "--with-includes" option) if
                you have packages installed in non-standard locations.

                Example: --with-libraries=/opt/gnu/lib:/usr/sup/lib.

        --enable-nls[=LANGUAGES]
                Enables Native Language Support (NLS), that is, the
                ability to display a program's messages in a language
                other than English. "LANGUAGES" is a space-separated list
                of codes of the languages that you want supported, for
                example --enable-nls='de fr'. (The intersection between
                your list and the set of actually provided translations
                will be computed automatically.) If you do not specify a
                list, then all available translations are installed.

                To use this option, you will need an implementation of the
                Gettext API; see above.

        --with-pgport=NUMBER
                Set "NUMBER" as the default port number for server and
                clients. The default is 5432. The port can always be
                changed later on, but if you specify it here then both
                server and clients will have the same default compiled in,
                which can be very convenient. Usually the only good reason
                to select a non-default value is if you intend to run
                multiple PostgreSQL servers on the same machine.

        --with-perl
                Build the PL/Perl server-side language.

        --with-python
                Build the PL/Python server-side language.

        --with-tcl
                Build the PL/Tcl server-side language.

        --with-tclconfig=DIRECTORY
                Tcl installs the file "tclConfig.sh", which contains
                configuration information needed to build modules
                interfacing to Tcl. This file is normally found
                automatically at a well-known location, but if you want to
                use a different version of Tcl you can specify the
                directory in which to look for it.

        --with-gssapi
                Build with support for GSSAPI authentication. On many
                systems, the GSSAPI (usually a part of the Kerberos
                installation) system is not installed in a location that
                is searched by default (e.g., "/usr/include", "/usr/lib"),
                so you must use the options "--with-includes" and
                "--with-libraries" in addition to this option. "configure"
                will check for the required header files and libraries to
                make sure that your GSSAPI installation is sufficient
                before proceeding.

        --with-krb5
                Build with support for Kerberos 5 authentication. On many
                systems, the Kerberos system is not installed in a
                location that is searched by default (e.g.,
                "/usr/include", "/usr/lib"), so you must use the options
                "--with-includes" and "--with-libraries" in addition to
                this option. "configure" will check for the required
                header files and libraries to make sure that your Kerberos
                installation is sufficient before proceeding.

        --with-krb-srvnam=NAME
                The default name of the Kerberos service principal (also
                used by GSSAPI). postgres is the default. There's usually
                no reason to change this unless you have a Windows
                environment, in which case it must be set to uppercase
                POSTGRES.

        --with-openssl
                Build with support for SSL (encrypted) connections. This
                requires the OpenSSL package to be installed. "configure"
                will check for the required header files and libraries to
                make sure that your OpenSSL installation is sufficient
                before proceeding.

        --with-pam
                Build with PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) support.

        --with-ldap
                Build with LDAP support for authentication and connection
                parameter lookup (see the documentation about client
                authentication and libpq for more information). On Unix,
                this requires the OpenLDAP package to be installed.
                "configure" will check for the required header files and
                libraries to make sure that your OpenLDAP installation is
                sufficient before proceeding. On Windows, the default
                WinLDAP library is used.

        --without-readline
                Prevents use of the Readline library (and libedit as
                well). This option disables command-line editing and
                history in psql, so it is not recommended.

        --with-libedit-preferred
                Favors the use of the BSD-licensed libedit library rather
                than GPL-licensed Readline. This option is significant
                only if you have both libraries installed; the default in
                that case is to use Readline.

        --with-bonjour
                Build with Bonjour support. This requires Bonjour support
                in your operating system. Recommended on Mac OS X.

        --with-ossp-uuid
                Use the OSSP UUID library when building
                "contrib/uuid-ossp". The library provides functions to
                generate UUIDs.

        --with-libxml
                Build with libxml (enables SQL/XML support). Libxml
                version 2.6.23 or later is required for this feature.

                Libxml installs a program "xml2-config" that can be used
                to detect the required compiler and linker options.
                PostgreSQL will use it automatically if found. To specify
                a libxml installation at an unusual location, you can
                either set the environment variable XML2_CONFIG to point
                to the "xml2-config" program belonging to the
                installation, or use the options "--with-includes" and
                "--with-libraries".

        --with-libxslt
                Use libxslt when building "contrib/xml2". "contrib/xml2"
                relies on this library to perform XSL transformations of
                XML.

        --enable-integer-datetimes
                Use 64-bit integer storage for datetimes and intervals,
                rather than the default floating-point storage. This
                reduces the range of representable values but guarantees
                microsecond precision across the full range (see the
                documentation about datetime datatypes for more
                information).

        --disable-spinlocks
                Allow the build to succeed even if PostgreSQL has no CPU
                spinlock support for the platform. The lack of spinlock
                support will result in poor performance; therefore, this
                option should only be used if the build aborts and informs
                you that the platform lacks spinlock support. If this
                option is required to build PostgreSQL on your platform,
                please report the problem to the PostgreSQL developers.

        --enable-thread-safety
                Make the client libraries thread-safe. This allows
                concurrent threads in libpq and ECPG programs to safely
                control their private connection handles. This option
                requires adequate threading support in your operating
                system.

        --with-system-tzdata=DIRECTORY
                PostgreSQL includes its own time zone database, which it
                requires for date and time operations. This time zone
                database is in fact compatible with the "zic" time zone
                database provided by many operating systems such as
                FreeBSD, Linux, and Solaris, so it would be redundant to
                install it again. When this option is used, the
                system-supplied time zone database in "DIRECTORY" is used
                instead of the one included in the PostgreSQL source
                distribution. "DIRECTORY" must be specified as an absolute
                path. "/usr/share/zoneinfo" is a likely directory on some
                operating systems. Note that the installation routine will
                not detect mismatching or erroneous time zone data. If you
                use this option, you are advised to run the regression
                tests to verify that the time zone data you have pointed
                to works correctly with PostgreSQL.

                This option is mainly aimed at binary package distributors
                who know their target operating system well. The main
                advantage of using this option is that the PostgreSQL
                package won't need to be upgraded whenever any of the many
                local daylight-saving time rules change. Another advantage
                is that PostgreSQL can be cross-compiled more
                straightforwardly if the time zone database files do not
                need to be built during the installation.

        --without-zlib
                Prevents use of the Zlib library. This disables support
                for compressed archives in pg_dump and pg_restore. This
                option is only intended for those rare systems where this
                library is not available.

        --enable-debug
                Compiles all programs and libraries with debugging
                symbols. This means that you can run the programs through
                a debugger to analyze problems. This enlarges the size of
                the installed executables considerably, and on non-GCC
                compilers it usually also disables compiler optimization,
                causing slowdowns. However, having the symbols available
                is extremely helpful for dealing with any problems that
                might arise. Currently, this option is recommended for
                production installations only if you use GCC. But you
                should always have it on if you are doing development work
                or running a beta version.

        --enable-profiling
                If using GCC, all programs and libraries are compiled so
                they can be profiled. On backend exit, a subdirectory will
                be created that contains the "gmon.out" file for use in
                profiling. This option is for use only with GCC and when
                doing development work.

        --enable-cassert
                Enables assertion checks in the server, which test for
                many "cannot happen" conditions. This is invaluable for
                code development purposes, but the tests can slow down the
                server significantly. Also, having the tests turned on
                won't necessarily enhance the stability of your server!
                The assertion checks are not categorized for severity, and
                so what might be a relatively harmless bug will still lead
                to server restarts if it triggers an assertion failure.
                This option is not recommended for production use, but you
                should have it on for development work or when running a
                beta version.

        --enable-depend
                Enables automatic dependency tracking. With this option,
                the makefiles are set up so that all affected object files
                will be rebuilt when any header file is changed. This is
                useful if you are doing development work, but is just
                wasted overhead if you intend only to compile once and
                install. At present, this option will work only if you use
                GCC.

        --enable-dtrace
                Compiles with support for the dynamic tracing tool DTrace.
                Operating system support for DTrace is currently only
                available in Solaris.

                To point to the "dtrace" program, the environment variable
                DTRACE can be set. This will often be necessary because
                "dtrace" is typically installed under "/usr/sbin", which
                might not be in the path. Additional command-line options
                for the "dtrace" program can be specified in the
                environment variable DTRACEFLAGS.

                To include DTrace support in a 64-bit binary, specify
                DTRACEFLAGS="-64" to configure. For example, using the GCC
                compiler:

./configure CC='gcc -m64' --enable-dtrace DTRACEFLAGS='-64' ...

                Using Sun's compiler:

./configure CC='/opt/SUNWspro/bin/cc -xtarget=native64' --enable-dtrace DTRACEFL
AGS='-64' ...

       If you prefer a C compiler different from the one "configure"
       picks, you can set the environment variable CC to the program of
       your choice. By default, "configure" will pick "gcc" if available,
       else the platform's default (usually "cc"). Similarly, you can
       override the default compiler flags if needed with the CFLAGS
       variable.
       You can specify environment variables on the "configure" command
       line, for example:
./configure CC=/opt/bin/gcc CFLAGS='-O2 -pipe'
       Here is a list of the significant variables that can be set in this
       manner:

        CC
                C compiler

        CFLAGS
                options to pass to the C compiler

        CPP
                C preprocessor

        CPPFLAGS
                options to pass to the C preprocessor

        DTRACE
                location of the "dtrace" program

        DTRACEFLAGS
                options to pass to the "dtrace" program

        LDFLAGS
                options to pass to the link editor

        LDFLAGS_SL
                linker options for shared library linking

        MSGFMT
                "msgfmt" program for native language support

        PERL
                Full path to the Perl interpreter. This will be used to
                determine the dependencies for building PL/Perl.

        PYTHON
                Full path to the Python interpreter. This will be used to
                determine the dependencies for building PL/Python.

        TCLSH
                Full path to the Tcl interpreter. This will be used to
                determine the dependencies for building PL/Tcl.

        XML2_CONFIG
                "xml2-config" program used to locate the libxml
                installation.

        YACC
                Yacc program (bison -y if using Bison)

    2. Build
       To start the build, type
gmake
       (Remember to use GNU make.) The build will take a few minutes
       depending on your hardware. The last line displayed should be
All of PostgreSQL is successfully made. Ready to install.
    3. Regression Tests
       If you want to test the newly built server before you install it,
       you can run the regression tests at this point. The regression
       tests are a test suite to verify that PostgreSQL runs on your
       machine in the way the developers expected it to. Type
gmake check
       (This won't work as root; do it as an unprivileged user.) The file
       "src/test/regress/README" and the documentation contain detailed
       information about interpreting the test results. You can repeat
       this test at any later time by issuing the same command.
    4. Installing The Files

     Note: If you are upgrading an existing system and are going to
     install the new files over the old ones, be sure to back up your
     data and shut down the old server before proceeding, as explained in
     the Section called Upgrading above.
       To install PostgreSQL enter
gmake install
       This will install files into the directories that were specified in
       step 1. Make sure that you have appropriate permissions to write
       into that area. Normally you need to do this step as root.
       Alternatively, you could create the target directories in advance
       and arrange for appropriate permissions to be granted.
       You can use gmake install-strip instead of gmake install to strip
       the executable files and libraries as they are installed. This will
       save some space. If you built with debugging support, stripping
       will effectively remove the debugging support, so it should only be
       done if debugging is no longer needed. install-strip tries to do a
       reasonable job saving space, but it does not have perfect knowledge
       of how to strip every unneeded byte from an executable file, so if
       you want to save all the disk space you possibly can, you will have
       to do manual work.
       The standard installation provides all the header files needed for
       client application development as well as for server-side program
       development, such as custom functions or data types written in C.
       (Prior to PostgreSQL 8.0, a separate gmake install-all-headers
       command was needed for the latter, but this step has been folded
       into the standard install.)
       Client-only installation: If you want to install only the client
       applications and interface libraries, then you can use these
       commands:
gmake -C src/bin install
gmake -C src/include install
gmake -C src/interfaces install
gmake -C doc install
       "src/bin" has a few binaries for server-only use, but they are
       small.

   Registering eventlog on Windows: To register a Windows eventlog library
   with the operating system, issue this command after installation:
regsvr32 pgsql_library_directory/pgevent.dll

   This creates registry entries used by the event viewer.

   Uninstallation: To undo the installation use the command "gmake
   uninstall". However, this will not remove any created directories.

   Cleaning: After the installation you can make room by removing the
   built files from the source tree with the command "gmake clean". This
   will preserve the files made by the "configure" program, so that you
   can rebuild everything with "gmake" later on. To reset the source tree
   to the state in which it was distributed, use "gmake distclean". If you
   are going to build for several platforms within the same source tree
   you must do this and re-configure for each build. (Alternatively, use a
   separate build tree for each platform, so that the source tree remains
   unmodified.)

   If you perform a build and then discover that your "configure" options
   were wrong, or if you change anything that "configure" investigates
   (for example, software upgrades), then it's a good idea to do "gmake
   distclean" before reconfiguring and rebuilding. Without this, your
   changes in configuration choices might not propagate everywhere they
   need to.

                           Post-Installation Setup

Shared Libraries

   On some systems that have shared libraries (which most systems do) you
   need to tell your system how to find the newly installed shared
   libraries. The systems on which this is *not* necessary include BSD/OS,
   FreeBSD, HP-UX, IRIX, Linux, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Tru64 UNIX (formerly
   Digital UNIX), and Solaris.

   The method to set the shared library search path varies between
   platforms, but the most widely usable method is to set the environment
   variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH like so: In Bourne shells ("sh", "ksh",
   "bash", "zsh"):
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/pgsql/lib
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH

   or in "csh" or "tcsh":
setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH /usr/local/pgsql/lib

   Replace /usr/local/pgsql/lib with whatever you set "--libdir" to in
   step 1. You should put these commands into a shell start-up file such
   as "/etc/profile" or "~/.bash_profile". Some good information about the
   caveats associated with this method can be found at
   http://www.visi.com/~barr/ldpath.html.

   On some systems it might be preferable to set the environment variable
   LD_RUN_PATH *before* building.

   On Cygwin, put the library directory in the PATH or move the ".dll"
   files into the "bin" directory.

   If in doubt, refer to the manual pages of your system (perhaps "ld.so"
   or "rld"). If you later on get a message like
psql: error in loading shared libraries
libpq.so.2.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

   then this step was necessary. Simply take care of it then.

   If you are on BSD/OS, Linux, or SunOS 4 and you have root access you
   can run:
/sbin/ldconfig /usr/local/pgsql/lib

   (or equivalent directory) after installation to enable the run-time
   linker to find the shared libraries faster. Refer to the manual page of
   "ldconfig" for more information. On FreeBSD, NetBSD, and OpenBSD the
   command is:
/sbin/ldconfig -m /usr/local/pgsql/lib

   instead. Other systems are not known to have an equivalent command.
     __________________________________________________________________

Environment Variables

   If you installed into "/usr/local/pgsql" or some other location that is
   not searched for programs by default, you should add
   "/usr/local/pgsql/bin" (or whatever you set "--bindir" to in step 1)
   into your PATH. Strictly speaking, this is not necessary, but it will
   make the use of PostgreSQL much more convenient.

   To do this, add the following to your shell start-up file, such as
   "~/.bash_profile" (or "/etc/profile", if you want it to affect every
   user):
PATH=/usr/local/pgsql/bin:$PATH
export PATH

   If you are using "csh" or "tcsh", then use this command:
set path = ( /usr/local/pgsql/bin $path )

   To enable your system to find the man documentation, you need to add
   lines like the following to a shell start-up file unless you installed
   into a location that is searched by default:
MANPATH=/usr/local/pgsql/man:$MANPATH
export MANPATH

   The environment variables PGHOST and PGPORT specify to client
   applications the host and port of the database server, overriding the
   compiled-in defaults. If you are going to run client applications
   remotely then it is convenient if every user that plans to use the
   database sets PGHOST. This is not required, however: the settings can
   be communicated via command line options to most client programs.
     __________________________________________________________________

                               Getting Started

   The following is a quick summary of how to get PostgreSQL up and
   running once installed. The main documentation contains more
   information.
    1. Create a user account for the PostgreSQL server. This is the user
       the server will run as. For production use you should create a
       separate, unprivileged account ("postgres" is commonly used). If
       you do not have root access or just want to play around, your own
       user account is enough, but running the server as root is a
       security risk and will not work.
adduser postgres
    2. Create a database installation with the "initdb" command. To run
       "initdb" you must be logged in to your PostgreSQL server account.
       It will not work as root.
root# mkdir /usr/local/pgsql/data
root# chown postgres /usr/local/pgsql/data
root# su - postgres
postgres$ /usr/local/pgsql/bin/initdb -D /usr/local/pgsql/data
       The "-D" option specifies the location where the data will be
       stored. You can use any path you want, it does not have to be under
       the installation directory. Just make sure that the server account
       can write to the directory (or create it, if it doesn't already
       exist) before starting "initdb", as illustrated here.
    3. At this point, if you did not use the "initdb" -A option, you might
       want to modify "pg_hba.conf" to control local access to the server
       before you start it. The default is to trust all local users.
    4. The previous "initdb" step should have told you how to start up the
       database server. Do so now. The command should look something like:
/usr/local/pgsql/bin/postgres -D /usr/local/pgsql/data
       This will start the server in the foreground. To put the server in
       the background use something like:
nohup /usr/local/pgsql/bin/postgres -D /usr/local/pgsql/data \
    </dev/null >>server.log 2>&1 </dev/null &
       To stop a server running in the background you can type:
kill `cat /usr/local/pgsql/data/postmaster.pid`
    5. Create a database:
createdb testdb
       Then enter
psql testdb
       to connect to that database. At the prompt you can enter SQL
       commands and start experimenting.
     __________________________________________________________________

                                  What Now?

     * The PostgreSQL distribution contains a comprehensive documentation
       set, which you should read sometime. After installation, the
       documentation can be accessed by pointing your browser to
       "/usr/local/pgsql/doc/html/index.html", unless you changed the
       installation directories.
       The first few chapters of the main documentation are the Tutorial,
       which should be your first reading if you are completely new to SQL
       databases. If you are familiar with database concepts then you want
       to proceed with part on server administration, which contains
       information about how to set up the database server, database
       users, and authentication.
     * Usually, you will want to modify your computer so that it will
       automatically start the database server whenever it boots. Some
       suggestions for this are in the documentation.
     * Run the regression tests against the installed server (using "gmake
       installcheck"). If you didn't run the tests before installation,
       you should definitely do it now. This is also explained in the
       documentation.
     * By default, PostgreSQL is configured to run on minimal hardware.
       This allows it to start up with almost any hardware configuration.
       The default configuration is, however, not designed for optimum
       performance. To achieve optimum performance, several server
       parameters must be adjusted, the two most common being
       shared_buffers and work_mem. Other parameters mentioned in the
       documentation also affect performance.
     __________________________________________________________________

                             Supported Platforms

   A platform (that is, a CPU architecture and operating system
   combination) is considered supported by the PostgreSQL development
   community if the code contains provisions to work on that platform and
   it has recently been verified to build and pass its regression tests on
   that platform. Currently, most testing of platform compatibility is
   done automatically by test machines in the PostgreSQL Build Farm. If
   you are interested in using PostgreSQL on a platform that is not
   represented in the build farm, but on which the code works or can be
   made to work, you are strongly encouraged to set up a build farm member
   machine so that continued compatibility can be assured.

   In general, PostgreSQL can be expected to work on these CPU
   architectures: x86, x86_64, IA64, PowerPC, PowerPC 64, S/390, S/390x,
   Sparc, Sparc 64, Alpha, ARM, MIPS, MIPSEL, M68K, and PA-RISC. Code
   support exists for M32R, NS32K, and VAX, but these architectures are
   not known to have been tested recently. It is often possible to build
   on an unsupported CPU type by configuring with "--disable-spinlocks",
   but performance will be poor.

   PostgreSQL can be expected to work on these operating systems: Linux
   (all recent distributions), Windows (Win2000 SP4 and later), FreeBSD,
   OpenBSD, NetBSD, Mac OS X, AIX, HP/UX, IRIX, Solaris, Tru64 Unix, and
   UnixWare. Other Unix-like systems may also work but are not currently
   being tested. In most cases, all CPU architectures supported by a given
   operating system will work. Look in the "doc/" directory of the source
   distribution to see if there is a FAQ document specific to your
   operating system, particularly if using an older system.

   If you have installation problems on a platform that is known to be
   supported according to recent build farm results, please report it to
   <pgsql-bugs@postgresql.org>. If you are interested in porting
   PostgreSQL to a new platform, <pgsql-ports@postgresql.org> is the
   appropriate place to discuss that.
